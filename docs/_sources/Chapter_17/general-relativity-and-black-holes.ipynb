In most cases, considering space and time separately was an adequate description of nature.  However, you should remember that relativity deals with a unified spacetime, where both space and time must be described in a new way near an object.\n",

The curving light beam actually does travel the *shorter* path.  If two space travelers were to lay meter sticks end-to-end along the two paths, the dashed path would require a greater number of meter sticks because it penetrates deeper into the curved space.  In addition, the curvature of space involves an accompanying slowing down of time, so clocks placed along the dashed path would actually *run more slowly*.

    "For this reason, a star that has collapsed down within the Schwarzschild radius is called a [**black hole**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole).  It is enclosed by the **event horizon**, which is a *spherical surface* at $r=R_S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the interior of a black hole is a region that is forever hidden from us, its properties can still be calculated.  A nonrotating black hole has a **singularity** (i.e., a point of zero volume and infinite density) at the center, where all the black hole's mass is located.  Spacetime is infinitely curved at the singularity.  Cloaking the central singularity is the event horizon, where there is a hypothesis dubbed the [Law of Cosmic Censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_censorship_hypothesis) that forbids a *naked singularity* from appearing without an associated event horizon (i.e., unclothed).\n",

In a sense, a black hole is a *frozen star* because the surface of the event horizon appears frozen from the outside.\n",

The astronomer's local inertial frame $S$ falls with a coordinate speed $dr/dt$ all the way to the event horizon.  During the acceleration, a monochromatic flashlight sends a pulse of photons in our direction once per second.  As the infall progresses, the light signals arrive farther and farther apart for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subsequent signals must travel a longer distance as the astronomer accelerates.  The proper time $\\tau$ is running more slowly than our coordinate time $t$ from the location (gravitational time dilation) and motion (special relativity time dilation) of the astronomer.\n",
    "2. The coordinate speed of light becomes slower as the astronomer approaches the black hole, so the signals travel back to us more slowly.\n",
    "3. The frequency of light waves we receive is increasingly redshifted.  This is cased by the astronomer's acceleration away from us and the gravitational redshift.  The redshifted light may be in a range that is not optimal for our detector.\n",
    "4. The light becomes dimmer as the rate at which the flashlight pulses decreases and the energy per photon $(hc/\\lambda)$ declines.\n",

    "However, the astronomer begins to feel stretched in the radial direction and compressed in the perpendicular direction.  The gravitational pull on the astronomer's feet (nearer to the black hole) is stronger than on the astronomer's head.  The variation in the direction of gravity from side to side produces a compression that is even more severe.  The differential *tidal forces* increase in strength as the astronomer approaches the event horizon.  The size of the local frame (where gravity is abolished) becomes smaller as the spatial variation in the gravitational acceleration vector increases.  this is why the astronomer need be indestructible, because the tidal force would tear the astronomer apart at a distance of several hundred kilometers from the black hole.\n",

    "  - The direct collapse of the core to a black hole may be responsible for the production of [collapsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapsar), whereas a delayed collapse of a rapidly rotating neutron star may result in a supranova ([Vietri & Stella (1998)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1998ApJ...507L..45V/PUB_PDF)).\n",
    "  - It is also possible that a neutron star in a close binary system may gravitationally strip enough mass from its companion that the neutron's self-gravity exceeds the ability of the degeneracy pressure to support it, resulting in a black hole.\n",
    "- **Intermediate-mass** black holes (IMBHs) may exist from $100\\ M_\\odot$ to $>10^3-10^4\\ M_\\odot$.\n",

    "  - It is not clear how these objects might form, although correlation of IMBHs with the cores of globular clusters and low-mass galaxies suggests that they develop through mergers of stars (to form supermassive stars that undergo core-collapse), or by the merger of stellar-mass black holes.\n",
    "- **Supermassive** black holes (SMBHs) range in mass from $10^5-10^9\\ M_\\odot$ and lie at the centers of many galaxies (probably most).  Our own Milky Way Galaxy has a central black hole of mass $M = (3.7 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^6\\ M_\\odot$.\n",
    "  - How these behemoths formed remains an open question.  One popular suggestion is that they formed from galaxy collisions.  Another is that they formed as an extension of the IMBH formation process.\n",
    "  - SMBHs appear to be closely linked with some bulk properties of galaxies, implying an important connection between galaxy formation and the formation of SMBHs.\n",

As a massive object spins, it induces a rotation in the surrounding spacetime, which is known as **frame dragging**.  The [**Kerr metric**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric) is used to describe rotating black holes, which was derived from Einstein's field equations by [Roy Kerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Kerr) in 1963.\n",

Spacetime within the ergosphere is rotating so rapidly that a particle's speed would exceed the speed of light to remain at the same angular coordinate (i.e., at the same $\\phi$ for a distant observer).

Ordinarily, the particles quickly recombine and disappear, but if one of the particles falls into the event horizon while its partner escapes, the disappearing act may be thwarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The black hole's gravitational energy was used to produce the particles, and so the escaping particle carried away some of the black hole's mass.  The net effect (as seen by an observer at a great distance) is the emission of particles by the black hole, known as [**Hawking radiation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation), accompanied by a reduction in the black hole's mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate at which energy is carried away by particles is inversely proportional to the square of the black hole's mass (or $1/M^2$).  For stellar-mass black holes, the emitted particles are photons and the emission rate is miniscule.  As the black hole's mass declines, the emission rate increases.  The final stage of a black hole's evaporation proceeds extremely rapidly, releasing a burst of all types of elementary particles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The lifetime of a primordial black hole prior to its evaporation $t_{\\rm evap}$ is quite long,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "t_{\\rm evap} &= 2560 \\pi^2 \\left(\\frac{2GM}{c^2} \\right) \\left(\\frac{M}{h}\\right), \\\\\n",
    "  &= 2 \\times 10^{67} \\left(\\frac{M}{M_\\odot}\\right)^3\\ \\rm yr.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the age of the universe is $13.7 \\times 10^9\\ \\rm yr$, this process is of no consequence for black holes formed by a collapsing star.  A primordial black hole with a mass of roughly $1.7 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\rm kg$ (${\\sim}$ a small [asteroid](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/asteroidfact.html)) would evaporate in about 13 billion years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final burst of Hawking radiation is thought to release high-energy ($\\approx 100\\ \\rm MeV$) gamma rays at a rate of $10^{13}\\ \\rm W$, together with electrons, positrons, and many other particles.  The subsequent decay of these particles should produce additional gamma rays that would be observable by space-based gamma observatories.  To date, the measurements of the cosmic *gamma-ray* background at this energy have not detected anything that can be identified with the demise of a nearby primordial black hole.\n",
